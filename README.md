Brainfuck in Scala, with infinite memory tape!

Build with `sbt assembly`

IO is stdin and stdout. Use redirection to read and write files.

* `-c` turns the input into a literal string
* `-v` prints verbose output (which there is none of yet)
* `-e` outputs the last value on the pointer as the exit code.
